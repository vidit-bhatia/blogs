Welcome to the Quantum Computing Journey! I'm thrilled you're here.

## A Different Kind of Tech Blog

This isn't your typical tech blog filled with framework tutorials or product reviews. This is a deep dive into one of the most fascinating frontiers of computing—**quantum computing**—and its potential path toward quantum machine learning and, speculatively, AGI.

But there's a twist: alongside the rigorous science, we'll explore philosophical parallels with **Vedanta**, an ancient Indian philosophy that offers profound insights into reality, consciousness, and the nature of observation.

## What Makes This Series Unique?

Most quantum computing resources either:

- Drown you in equations without building intuition, or
- Oversimplify to the point of being misleading

I'm taking a different approach: **beginner-friendly explanations that don't sacrifice accuracy**, building from first principles to advanced concepts in a structured 13-post series.

And unlike pure technical blogs, we'll pause periodically to reflect on how quantum concepts like superposition, measurement, and entanglement resonate with Vedantic ideas about consciousness, reality, and non-duality—always clearly distinguishing science from philosophy.

## What You'll Learn

This series will take you on a journey through:

1. **Quantum Foundations** - Why classical Boolean logic fails, what superposition really means, the no-cloning theorem, and the role of the observer
2. **Quantum Gates & Operations** - Single and multi-qubit gates, the Bloch sphere, CNOT gates, and entanglement
3. **Building Quantum Systems** - Quantum circuits, universal gate sets, and how to think in quantum
4. **Advanced Concepts** - Reversibility, unitarity, and quantum interference

Along the way, we'll weave in **3 philosophical reflection posts** that explore conceptual parallels between quantum mechanics and Vedantic thought—not as scientific proof, but as complementary lenses for understanding reality.

## Who Is This For?

You're in the right place if you're:

- A **software engineer** curious about quantum computing
- An **ML enthusiast** interested in quantum machine learning
- A **STEM student** looking for an accessible yet rigorous introduction
- Someone fascinated by the intersection of **science and philosophy**

You don't need a physics degree—just curiosity and a willingness to think differently about reality.

## The Road Ahead

Our first real post, [Why Your Classical AND Gates Won't Work in Quantum Computing](/blogs/2025/11/30/why-boolean-logic-fails-quantum/), sets the stage by explaining why the Boolean logic that powers every computer you've ever used completely breaks down in the quantum realm.

From there, we'll build systematically toward understanding quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and the speculative paths toward AGI—always grounding the discussion in what's scientifically established versus what's frontier research versus what's philosophical reflection.

## A Personal Note

I created this blog because I believe the most interesting ideas live at the intersections—where quantum physics meets computation, where ancient philosophy meets modern science, where rigorous thinking meets open-minded exploration.

If that resonates with you, I think you'll enjoy this journey.

Let's explore the quantum world together. 🌌
