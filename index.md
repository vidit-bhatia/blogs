title: Welcome to the Quantum Journey
---

Exploring the fascinating world of quantum computing, from classical Boolean logic to quantum gates, with thoughtful reflections on consciousness and Vedanta.

## About This Series

This blog series takes you on a journey from the foundations of classical computing through the strange and beautiful world of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum machine learning. Along the way, we'll pause to reflect on philosophical parallels with Vedantic thought—not as proof, but as complementary lenses for understanding reality and consciousness.
